## Problem:
Limited Access: Traditional real estate investments often require significant capital, excluding a large portion of potential investors from participating in the market.

High Costs: The high cost of real estate properties makes it challenging for individuals with limited financial resources to enter the market and benefit from potential returns.

Lack of Diversification: The barriers to entry in real estate often limit investors' ability to diversify their portfolios, leading to a concentration of wealth in a single asset class.

## Solution:
NFTBrick is bridging the gap between real estate and blockchain technology. By leveraging the power of fractional NFTs, we are providing a platform that allows investors to buy and sell fractionalized portions of real estate. This groundbreaking approach enables everyone to invest in properties they are passionate about, regardless of their financial limitations.
